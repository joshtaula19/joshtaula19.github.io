<h1 class="black-head">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>

<p class="black-text">I would love to work in software development or front-end development one day. I love being able to create things and work on projects which I love. With a passion for video games as well as music I'd love to one day be able to intertwine my passions with my work. Also I've always wanted to create my own video game so that would definitely be a bonus!</p>

<h1 class="black-head">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h1>

<p class="black-text">When it comes to strengths, I believe that I am a very resilient person. No matter how hard or how long a project may take to finish or learn, I will do everything that I can to make sure it gets done, and gets done right. The only thing I hate more than losing is giving up. I believe that this is something which I learnt from playing football all my life. No matter how hard things get, I am always willing to give it my all. I think that I also work well with others, being able to meet new people in the same space definitely benefits my learning, it can be intimidating sometimes having to figure everything out on your own so being able to work with others definitely helps me. When it comes to limitations I think one of my main struggles is time management. Although I feel over the duration of this course so far its been getting better and better, it still is something which I find quite challenging at times and is something that I am definitely trying to improve on.

<h1 class="white-head">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>

<p class="white-text">I think being more open to asking people for help. Even though it kind of goes against what I was saying about working with others, I can be quite stubborn when it comes to getting stuck on an issue and try to always figure it out for myself. Although I have no issue in working with others, I still sometimes struggle to ask others for help. </p>

<h1 class="white-head">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h1>


<p class="white-text">I think that a way in which I will be able to manage the workload in this programme is by not being afraid. I think that sometimes in courses like these it can be easy to be intimidated and shy away, whether that is working productively with others or trying to get through a lot of work. Making sure I manage my time wisely and communicate when neccessary is vital for being able to succeed. Staying honest with myself and honest with others is a way in which myself and those working with me will be able to understand the positions I am in and what I need to do to get to where I wan't to be. To make sure I am not overworking or letting things build up I will make sure to be taking regular breaks and getting outside. Sports and activity is always something which has been important to me and being able to maintain that I think will benefit my learning as a whole as it will, not only keep me sane, but also make sure that my mind and body is in the best conditions to get the work I need done. </p>

<h1 class="white-head">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>

<p class="white-text">At the moment our best lines of communication when in need of help is through our discord server, being able to communicate with facilitators and older students has been super helpful and benefitial. It is also extremely useful the fact that majority of the time, someone will be online to help you with what you need. Whether it has to do with a project you are working on or just general advice for trying to stay calm under a heavy workload. </p>

<h1 class="black-head">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>

<p class="black-text">From the facilitation team I expect a sense of willingness to help as well as patience. Luckily they've already made it super clear to us that they are available to help almost 24/7, but I'm hoping that those ideals can continue throughout the rest of the course as well as being patient with the most of us as it is a pretty intimidating course and we are all learning everything for the first time :) </p>

<h1 class="black-head">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>

<p class="black-text">Just mainly making sure I am still leaving enough time to be able to do the things I love. This comes down to time management with my work, chipping away at it everyday will be much more benefitial as oppossed to trying to cram everything in to a few days. Things such as playing football, working, spending time with my family, and having time for myself to play games, will all be possible as long as I make sure I'm getting through my work on time as well as slow and steady. </p>
