    <h1 class="black-head">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>

    <p class="black-text">
        My long term goal is to go into software development. I would love to start out working as a full stack web developer and hopefully continue on to working on more software based roles. I also have always wanted to work in the video game industry! I've always 
        been super passionate about video games and their creation so hopefully one day I would be able to work in that field. I think that the skills I'll be able to learn from this course will set me in the right direction towards this goal. Although software development is my long term goal, 
        I do understand that its quite a ways away and will require a lot of work and time so for now I'm content with working my way towards full stack development.

    <h1 class="black-head">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>

    <p class="black-text">
        I think that based on my response from the Foundations Learning Plan, a lot of what I said there still stays the same. I feel I am still quite a resilient person and try my best to never give up especially when the programming becomes difficult. I have enjoyed the small portions of 
        working with others and I think it definitely benefits me overall as I am able to learn lots off of others. In terms of my time management, it definitely has gotten better from what it was when I started but I still have a lot of work to do in that department. Especially with the Bootcamp
        just around the corner.

        <h1 class="white-head">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
        
        <br>

        <p class="white-text">
            I think that the biggest non-technical challenge I will run into during the Bootcamp will be managing my work life balance. I'm definitely the type of person who likes to do a lot of things and extra curricular activities, this includes playing football, spending time with friends 
            and family, as well as trying to work. This is definitely something which I already find quite challenging so I feel like with the workload increasing, this is definitely where time management will become an important part of my daily routine. Making sure to try my best to 
            plan out my days and making sure I'm prioritizing the right things.

        <h1 class="white-head">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>

        <br>

        <p class="white-text">
            I think one thing I would like to put into practice is being more open-minded to accepting help. A lot of the time growing up I felt too dumb or silly to ask questions, so now that I am older it has caught up to me in some ways and I often stray away from asking for help or asking 
            questions at all. I always feel as if I have to try and solve everything by myself. This is something which I'd like to grow out of the habit of doing, I think that one of the best ways in which I can grow as a developer as well as a person is being willing to accepting help 
            from others around me and those smarter than me!

    <h1 class="black-head">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>

    <br>

    <p class="black-text">
        My last answer I feel like was pretty similar to my one now. Keeping patience with us noobies! They already have been great at offering support and being understanding of outside conditions which may get in the way of our studies. I hope that throughout the bootcamp 
        this mindset can stay the same and they still offer us the great support they've already been giving. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <h1 class="black-head">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h1>

    <br>

    <p class="black-text">
        My expectation for myself through the Bootcamp is just to keep working hard! I hope I can, at the end of the bootcamp, look back on this blog and feel like I have accomplished everything I'm setting out for myself. I also am making a pact to myself 
        to please, future me, improve my time management. It's so important for succeeding in coding and things will only start to spiral out of control if I don't sort it out! Other than that I hope that by the end of the bootcamp I'm feeling confident in my coding abilities 
        and will still be feeling fulfilled with the work im doing!

    <body>
<h1 class="black-head">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>

<br>

<p class="black-text">I would love to work in software development or front-end development one day. I love being able to create things and work on projects which I love. With a passion for video games as well as music I'd love to one day be able to intertwine my passions with my work. Also I've always wanted to create my own video game so that would definitely be a bonus!</p>

<h1 class="black-head">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h1>

<br>

<p class="black-text">When it comes to strengths, I believe that I am a very resilient person. No matter how hard or how long a project may take to finish or learn, I will do everything that I can to make sure it gets done, and gets done right. The only thing I hate more than losing is giving up. I believe that this is something which I learnt from playing football all my life. No matter how hard things get, I am always willing to give it my all. I think that I also work well with others, being able to meet new people in the same space definitely benefits my learning, it can be intimidating sometimes having to figure everything out on your own so being able to work with others definitely helps me. When it comes to limitations I think one of my main struggles is time management. Although I feel over the duration of this course so far its been getting better and better, it still is something which I find quite challenging at times and is something that I am definitely trying to improve on.

<h1 class="white-head">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>

<br>

<p class="white-text">I think being more open to asking people for help. Even though it kind of goes against what I was saying about working with others, I can be quite stubborn when it comes to getting stuck on an issue and try to always figure it out for myself. Although I have no issue in working with others, I still sometimes struggle to ask others for help. </p>

<br>

<h1 class="white-head">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h1>

<br>

<p class="white-text">I think that a way in which I will be able to manage the workload in this programme is by not being afraid. I think that sometimes in courses like these it can be easy to be intimidated and shy away, whether that is working productively with others or trying to get through a lot of work. Making sure I manage my time wisely and communicate when neccessary is vital for being able to succeed. Staying honest with myself and honest with others is a way in which myself and those working with me will be able to understand the positions I am in and what I need to do to get to where I wan't to be. To make sure I am not overworking or letting things build up I will make sure to be taking regular breaks and getting outside. Sports and activity is always something which has been important to me and being able to maintain that I think will benefit my learning as a whole as it will, not only keep me sane, but also make sure that my mind and body is in the best conditions to get the work I need done. </p>

<br>

<h1 class="white-head">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>

<br>

<p class="white-text">At the moment our best lines of communication when in need of help is through our discord server, being able to communicate with facilitators and older students has been super helpful and benefitial. It is also extremely useful the fact that majority of the time, someone will be online to help you with what you need. Whether it has to do with a project you are working on or just general advice for trying to stay calm under a heavy workload. </p>

<br>

<body>
<h1 class="black-head">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>

<br>

<p class="black-text">From the facilitation team I expect a sense of willingness to help as well as patience. Luckily they've already made it super clear to us that they are available to help almost 24/7, but I'm hoping that those ideals can continue throughout the rest of the course as well as being patient with the most of us as it is a pretty intimidating course and we are all learning everything for the first time :) </p>

<br>

<h1 class="black-head">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>

<br>

<p class="black-text">Just mainly making sure I am still leaving enough time to be able to do the things I love. This comes down to time management with my work, chipping away at it everyday will be much more benefitial as oppossed to trying to cram everything in to a few days. Things such as playing football, working, spending time with my family, and having time for myself to play games, will all be possible as long as I make sure I'm getting through my work on time as well as slow and steady. </p>
