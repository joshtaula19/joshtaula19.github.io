        <h1 class="black-head">How to get out of a sticky situation</h1>
        <p class="black-text">Throughout this most recent sprint (sprint 5) I ran into so many issues, some bigger, and some smaller.
            A lot of the time it felt easier to just give up, also felt pretty out of my depth a lot of the time. One of the main things 
            was just to keep going. One big problem I ran into, and have struggled with in the past, is understanding loops. 
            A concept which i've struggled with over and over. This time was a little different from the last as I had learnt and put into practice 
            different problem solving techniques. One of the main techniques which helped me was asking peers of help. I was 
            fortunate enough to have friends which spent a lot of time at university studying computer science and they were 
            able to help me when I was stuck. One thing which I found quite difficult in this was asking for help in it self. It can be 
            intimidating as well as feel silly to ask simple questions. Once I was able to tackle that hurdle 
            it helped me get to where I needed to be.

        <h1 class="black-head">Eleganty Solved a Problem</h1>
        <p class="black-text">One of many issues I ran into was around math calculations as well as simple typos in my code,
            a lot of the time it would cause headaches and anger as I was unable to figure out what was wrong. I realised that 
            sitting at the computer for such a long time was only making things worse. One thing that benefited me greatly was as 
            simple as taking a break for a little bit. Getting a cup of tea/coffee and just taking some time away from the screen 
            to reset my brain a little bit. When I was able to come back to it I came in with a clear head and was able to figure out 
            what was missing. Making sure I wasn't rushing or pushing myself too much helped me to understand where I was going wrong.

        <h1 class="black-head">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h1>
        <p class="black-text">
            Psuedocode 5/10, Although I would say I'm confident with the idea of this, putting it into practice is where I feel I am lacking
            <br>
            <br>
            Trying something 10/10, This is definitely one of my main strengths as I tend to follow the trial and error statue and I think
            it helps me understand a lot of the code I am writing 
            <br>
            <br>
            Rubber ducky method 9/10, I am pretty confident with this one!
            <br>
            <br>
            Reading error messages 8/10, I definitely try my best to understand the error messages and they help guide me a lot, but 
            I only can understand so much at the current level I am at
            <br>
            <br>
            Console.logging 6/10, Although I clearly understand the usefulness of this practice, I don't use it as much as I should
            <br>
            <br>
            Googling 10000/10, google is my best friend when coding!
            <br>
            <br>
            Asking your peers for help 9/10, I've been lucky enough to have a few friends who know their way around coding and love annoying them for help.
            <br>
            <br>
            Asking coaches for help 4/10, although this is a skill which I really need to improve on and is a super useful tool, I think because I have friends who 
            are good coders as well, my first instinct is to ask them first.
            <br>
            <br>
            Improving your process with reflection 7/10, I think that I do reflect alot on not only my code but the way I go about it, lots of room for improvement regardless!

        <h1 class="black-head">Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h1>
        <p class="black-text">I think most people can relate to feeling too dumb or silly to ask questions, one thing I've learnt from this course is that there are 
            no stupid questions! It can be hard to get over the hurdle of feeling dumb for asking a question but it is one of the best ways to learn and grow not only in coding
            but in any walk of life. Definietly in the future of this course I want to try and ask more questions, regardless of what they are.
