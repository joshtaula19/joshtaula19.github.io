        <h2 class="head-center">What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p class="txt-center">
            It's hard to know where to even start for something like JavaScript, so I feel the best place to start is to understanding where it fits in with HTML and CSS. If we imagine all three of these elements as a calculator
            we can view HTML as the motherboard. This is where all the basic functionalities of the calculator are held. CSS would be the style of the calculator, this could be something like the colour of your calculator being blue. 
            Then when we look at JavaScript, we can view this as all the buttons on the calculator. This is the point which really gives it life and makes it interactive! 
        <br>
        <br>
            Within Javascript we also have the pleasure of introducing what is known as the Document Object Model, but the cool kids call it DOM. This can be viewed as the instruction manual which comes with our calculator,
            it is the way in which JavaScript interacts with the contents of our website, or calculator. This information that DOM collects is known as nodes. 
            Through this, JavaScript can interact with the web page and make changes 
            through these nodes!

        <h2 class="head-center">Control Flow and Loops</h2>
        <p class="txt-center">
            Control Flow and Loops are concepts which at first are quite difficult to understand, especially when you see the code which is put in front of you. But not to fear! The way in which I best love to understand 
            both these concepts is by thinking of a sandwich. Control Flow would be the sequence of steps we follow in order to make the sandwich. This could be gathering your ingredients, then preparing them on the counter, 
            then putting together the sandwhich, and then finally getting to eat. Loops is something which, in this instance, would squeeze right into the middle there. Loops can be understood as placing the ingredients into our sandwhich.
            Loops is a repetitive action which repeats until all the ingredients within our selection have been used up.

        <h2 class ="head-center">Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <p class="txt-center">Compared to before, Arrays and Objects are concepts which are a little bit easier to get the hang of, both of these tools within JavaScript are used to store different forms of data in different ways.
            <br>
            <br> Let me show you!
        </p>
        <img src="/images/arrays-exam.png" alt="arrays" class="piccys" height="100">
        <p class="txt-center">
            Above we can see an example of an array! In our list we have; apples, bananas, and oranges. Here we can see an ordered collection of the elements within our array. These are also identified by the index in which 
            it is positioned within our list. Elements within the array are numbered ALWAWYS starting from 0. In this case, apple is 0, banana is 1, and orange is 2. Although there are three elements within our array, 
            we always start the count at 0. 
        </p>
        <img src="/images/objects-exam.png" alt="objects" class="piccys" height="200">
        <p class="txt-center">
            Above we can see an example of Objects!! These lists are similar to arrays but are read a bit differently. In this case, we see a collection of "key-value" pairs. Keys in this case are represented as; 
            name, age, and city, whereas our values are; John, 30, and New York. Data within these objects, unlike arrays, are not guaranteed to be in order. We use the keys rather to identify them.

        <h2 class="head-center">Functions</h2>
        <p class="txt-center">A function in JavaScript is a block of code in which specific tasks or value calculations are carried out inside of. This can include reusable pieces of code and can be executed whenever you need! 
            The idea around the reusability of these chuncks of code is especially my favourite because it not only provides for super clean and clear way of writing code, but also is super efficient and consistant.
            When you are writing with a function you are pretty much designating a specific task to that function, an example of this could be like calculating how many sides are on a rectangle, or how many times 
            has a customer ordered a loaf of bread. The opportunities and uses for functions are almost endless, and within JavaScript they are a personal favourite of mine! </p>
