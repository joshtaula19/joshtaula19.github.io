    <h2>Identity and Values!</h2>

        <h1 class="black-head">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h1>

        <p class="black-text">Trying to think back to a time where I made an ethical decision is a difficult task, although one thing that comes to mind is a decision I had to make when I was 13 years old in school. One of my friends had lied to our teacher last minute to get out of taking a test, knowing that I, at the time, had also not prepared well enough for this test was unhappy that they got away with lying about being sick in order to get more time to study for the test and eventually take it at a later date. Knowing that this was an end of year exam and it put my friend at an advantage to the rest of my class, I considered telling on him as I thought it was unfair and almost deemed it as cheating in order to score better on this test. The ethical decision at hand was whether I valued this friendship more or staying academically integeral. The decision I chose was to not tell on my friend. Weighing up the options, I realised that I valued my friendship and the trust they put in me more than a test in school. Although I definitely dont condone or reccomend cheating in any way. I am grateful that I made this decision as now looking back on it I can't even remember what the test was about and I am still good friends with that person to this day. I definitely in no way regret the decision I made and I think that I value loyalty and trust in my everyday life over a middle school test. </p>
        
        <h1 class="black-head">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h1>
        
        <p class="black-text">I as a 22 year old student am extremely priveliged and lucky to have live the life I have lived so far, I spent majority of the first 16 years of my life growing up in New York City going to an international school for other children of diplomats. Due to these circumstances I am extremely lucky to have experienced and been surrounded by other students from all around the world. I grew up learning about different cultures and histories of places I didn't even know existed, and rather than just learning about them, these cultures and different people's were celebrated at my school. I think that this has been super benefitial to my upbringing because from an early age I was exposed to every type of human and culture imaginable, and being in that position for such a long time it became more than normal to me to be working around lots of different people with different backgrounds. Being able to grow up with no biased or agenda against any sort of religion or culture has been an absolute privelage and it provides me a sense of comfort when going into a lot of social situations as I love to learn about new people and where they have come from. Through this I have also learnt a very important value to me which is respect. Learning to respect others and treat others as I'd want to be treated regardless of their history or where they have come from. Learning not to judge people based on how they've gotten to where they are today or how they look.</p>

        <h1 class="white-head">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h1>
        
        <p class="white-text">I think that one of my most important strengths is talking to others. Since I was a kid I have loved team sports, working in teams has always been something which I've enjoyed and have felt more comfortable doing than working alone. I think that this will be benefitial in my learning as I understand that a lot of learning in code and programming revolves around working in teams. Another great part of that connecting back to the last question is that I will be getting to work with likeminded people with all kinds of different backgrounds, and the way in which everyone gets to the same point is something that interests me. Another strength which I value is being able to never give up. I sometimes like to refer to it as trial and error. I have always been someone that loves to have a million different interests and hobbies and try new things, sometimes things don't work out but thats okay! Trying new things until I find the right solution or situation which I am confident and comfortable in, I think is better than never trying at all. I think that both of these will benefit me on my learning journey because, with being cofident in social situations, I am anticipating to be working in lots of teams and groups in order to get a certain task done. When looking at never giving up/trial and error, there is no doubt in my mind that I run into issues or problems when trying to understand different concepts within code but practice makes perfect and I'm sure I'll make lots of mistakes along the way. </p>
        
        <h1 class="white-head">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h1>
        
        <p class="white-text">I think that one of my main faults when it comes to my learning is time management. As mentioned in the last question, I love to have 1 million different hobbies and interests, and although this is something that is good it also can be a cause for distraction and procrastination. I love to try and fill up my time with things I love to do but sometimes that tends to get in the way of my studies and deadlines. Even with this task right now there is about 4 hours left until this is suppossed to be finished lol. Regardless it is definitely a trait which I am trying to work on and I think is vital when trying to learn code. Time management is definitely a key to success within almost any walk of life and I think as I practice more and become more confident in the work which i am, it will become easier to avoid procrastination.</p> 
        
        <h1 class="white-head">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h1>
        
        <p class="white-text">One time when I was trying to work productively with others was while I was studying at the University Of Canterbury, doing a degree in music, I was put into a group and was tasked with creating a song together. Each group was assigned one 3rd year student and the rest being 1st and 2nd year students. As the 3rd year student I was designated the leader and was in charge of bringing together the group as well as making the final decisions on what song we make. Due to this being a Music course, students who enjoyed all types of different genres were involved. This caused a lot of problems as some group members didn't like or want to create songs in a certain genre that others may have wanted to. Being the group leader it was my job to make the final decision. I felt a lot of pressure within this role because I was unsure of the best way to go about it. We ended up doing a group vote and going with the majority decision. Which in turn left at least one group member unhappy. I think that although we got the assignment in and got a good grade on it, I probably would go a different route about a situation like that now looking back on it. I think that something like asking everyone to create a list of 10 genres they enjoy and trying to find common ground as oppossed to a majority decision might work better. Or even trying a genre which no one was familiar with in order to keep everyone at a level playing field and that way no one gets their way and everyone is trying something fun and new.</p>
