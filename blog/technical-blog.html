<h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p class="about-dib">Display inline and inline blocks can be seen as a way in which a box appears and wraps around the screen. This box can include anything from images to text. 
    Say that you are trying to place an image within the bounderies of a text, you would use display:inline or display:inline-block to achieve this.
    <br>
    <br>Here are some examples:
</p>
</body>

<body>
    <div class="brn-background white-text">
<h4>display:inline</h4>
<p>When looking at inline, this certain box or element which we would like to place will sit on top of the other element, disregarding any margins or paddings within the existing element.
    <br>
    <br>This is how it looks:  
</p>
<img src="/images/display-inline.jpg" alt="display-inline">

<p>
As seen in our code above, we use the "display: inline;" prompt in order to place our box on top of our already exisitng element, being the text on screen.
<br>
<br>
On our page, it should look something like this: 
</p>
<img src="/images/display-inline2.jpg" alt="display-inline2">
<br>
<p>
As shown in the prompt above, we now have our green box placed over the already existing text, something like this can be useful for wanting to highlight or put emphasis on a certain text. Or if you just want to place a photo
in the middle of ur text. 
</p>
    </div>
</body>

<body>
<h3>display:inline-block</h3>
<p>When using inline-block it carries a similar role to inline except this element will respect the width, height and padding of the already existing element, but can still sit within that same region.
    <br>
    <br>Here is an example:
</p>
<img src="/images/inline-block2.jpg" alt="inline-block2">
<p>As can be seen in our code above, we have now added the "display:inline-block" prompt to our code, lets see what it does!</p>

<img src="/images/inline-block.jpg" alt="inline-block">
<br>
<p>We have now added inline-block into our text, as can be seen in the picture above, our green box is still sitting within the existing element. This time our green box does not overlap any of the existing element
    and stays true to our already existing width, height and padding created by our text. 
</p>
</body>

<body>
    <div class="brn-background white-text">
<h4>display:block</h4>
<p>When working with display block it is most similar to inline-block but this time there is a line break between 
    each element. This could be seen similarly to if you were placing a picture between each sentence and it was ordered one on top of the other.
 <br>
 <br>Lets try it out!
</p>
<img src="/images/display-block.jpg" alt="block">
<p>In the code above we can see that we've now added our "display:block" prompt to our code, i wonder if there will be any surprises!</p>

<img src="/images/display-block2.jpg" alt="block2">
<p>WOW! its shrek... But as you can see in our prompt above, there are now line breaks after every time the image appears. Yet our new element is still sitting within the original text.</p>
