<h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p class="about-dib">Display inline and inline blocks can be seen as a way in which a box appears and wraps around the screen. This box can include anything from images to text. 
    Say that you are trying to place an image within the bounderies of a text, you would use display:inline or display:inline-block to achieve this.
    <br>Here are some examples:
</p>
</body>

<body>
    <div class="brn-background">
<h3>display:inline</h3>
<p>When looking at display:inline, this certain box or element which we would like to place will sit on top of the other element, disregarding any margins or paddings.
<br>This is how it looks in css
