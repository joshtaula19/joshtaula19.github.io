   <h1 class="black-head">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>

   <ul class="black-text">
        <li>I am and also am not as smart as I thought I was</li>
        <br>
        <li>Hard work beats all, also PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!</li>
        <br>
        <li>Taking time away and not trying to rush through things is so important! Not just for your brain but also for your success.</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <h1 class="black-head">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>

   <ul class="black-text">
        <li>Values: These are the guides in which develop and influence our decision making and the way in which we act. This can be through a personal matter or the way in which we communicate with others in our workplace. When it comes to programming
            this revolves around the idea of using our technology at hand in a responsible and honest matter.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Empathy: This is a trope which we try and follow in our everyday lives. This can be worked through the way in which we work with others, speak to others and treat others in either a personal or work setting. Empathy can benefit the way in which we design through programming
            in turn creating a more user-friendly program, which anyone can benefit from. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Self Awareness: This idea focuses on what we as individuals can identifiy about our own strengths and weaknesses as a person and as a collaborator. This is vital in programming as being aware of the way in which you work by yourself as well as with others 
            can be the defining factor when it comes to succeeding in this space. </li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <h1 class="black-head">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
        <p class="black-text">I was most surprised about how much self reflection was involved. Especially when it came to understanding my values and my strengths and weaknesses as a person.<br> I think although these were ideas in which I had thought about before
         I didn't fully understand, when starting, how relevant it actually was when it comes to programming and working with a programming team.
   </p>
   <br>
   <h1 class="black-head">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
        <p class="black-text">For me the most challenging parts of the core learning was trying my best to be as honest with myself as possible. Its easy for my own or for anyones ego to get in the way of being true to yourself and trying to answer a lot of these 
            questions honestly. An example might be when listing my own strengths and weaknesses, it could be easy for me to say how great I am at everything but that would just be defeating the purpose of this core learning. Its less about what you are good at and what you are 
            bad at, but moreso how you can improve upon your weaknesses and use your strengths to your advantage within your learning. 
        </p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="black-head">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>
        <p class="black-text">I think that it is because as humans we are always looking for ways in which we can fast track or shortcut our way through challenges. These core learning exercises put an emphasis on what you as a person are capable of and what you potentially 
            could be capable of if honest with yourself and those around you. It also benefits us as programmers when we go from spending a lot of time on our own coding to being able to work cohesively with others on group projects or assignments. Learning the core elements 
            also benefits the way in which you learn, being able to find the most ideal and benefitial route for which you are able to understand and apply knowledge within the coding sphere. 
        </p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="black-head">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
        <p class="black-text">I do not think it was a waste of time at all, I think that a lot of the core learning is so vital when it comes to learning the program. Not only are we learning to understand the ways in which we learn and apply our knowledge to things 
            but also we learn the best ways to work with others. A lot of people who take up coding/programming might not be the most social type of person so I think it can be super benefitial for people as such to introduce them into different ways of working with 
            and understanding others. Also can teach you a lot about the best ways to allocate your time which is super important within programming. Being able to time manage to a high level can gift you a lot of success and take a way a lot of the stress which can come 
            from programming.
