    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

    <h1 class="black-head">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h1>

    <p class="black-text">Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people in many ways. It not only shows the benefits when reconnecting severed links in the brain but also puts an emphasis on how important practice is to maintining and expanding on knowledge. It also identifies how it can help in so many different avenues when it comes to acquiring knowledge. As well as introduces creating good habits when it comes to practicing a certain skill and how it thickens the links in your brain which store this information. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="black-head">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
    </h1>

    <p class="black-text">This can be directly associated with this current course. When looking at engaging with these principles, practicing code everyday is a great example of strengthening those links in the brain which store all the information. If I go too long without practicing code my brain will eventually start to "prune" certain functions and fundamentals of the information I have learnt.
    </p>

    <h1 class="black-head">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h1>

    <p class="black-text">One of the main ways is practice. There could not be more of an emphasis on practice when talking about neuroplasticity. This is the most vital way to keep the brain active and constantly strengthening these neural pathways. Overtime with more and more practice, your brain will eventually not have to work as hard when working in these sectors because it will almost feel like second nature. Another great way to increse it is by working in groups. For myself, being able to ask questions and bounce ideas off others, practicing speaking and listening in whatever subject helps a lot when trying to understand something. Being able to verbally work as oppossed to just writing/typing things out definitely helps strengthen those bonds.

    <p class="black-text">This link was super helpful for me as it not only had multiple videos, as I feel like im a very visual learner, but also breaks things down super easily into different sections and areas around Neuroplasticity. It also features links to other sources which are useful such as books, podcasts, readings and other youtube videos.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

        <h1 class="white-head">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h1>

        <p class="white-text">Growth mindset is an idea which pushes for a different approach to criticism. Instead of pushing the idea of pass or fail. This could be shown through test results. Typically a student might receive the grade pass or fail, fail being an F. What growth mindset encourages is changing that fail to a 'not yet', this encourages the idea and room for improvement. This is relevant because especially in todays day and age, a lot of students are less encouraged to complete their schooling, and this is heightened if they see a fail grade making them feel as if they are a failure. The idea of them 'not yet' being where they need to be to pass, encourages that they are not a failure but have just not yet reached the destination they need to be at.</p>

        <h1 class="white-head">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>

        <p class="white-text">Yes I was actually quite surprised with how benefitial this could be. Especially when thinking back to my own time back in school, I also felt quite unmotivated when I would see a failing grade. It definitely gave me a different persepective and outlook on how schooling and studies should be run, a lot of the way things in the past as well as still now are run tend to drive students away from trying and trying again.
        </p>

        <h1 class="white-head">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h1>

        <p class="white-text">I think that I will try my best to make sure that I don't give up too easily as well as trying to realise that although I may not be at the point I want to be in terms of my learning, but eventually I will get there. With more practice as well as trial and error I will eventually get to a point where I am satisfied.</p>

        <p class="white-text">this is a super useful source as it helped me understand deeper what a growth mindset is. It also provides very useful information on how I can develop different skills to acquire a better growth mindset.

    <h1 class="black-head">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h1>

    <p class="black-text">I think that these ideas both work really well with each other. They are both tropes which I feel I unintentionally was already trying to implement into my studying. Practice as well as not giving up. If I get stuck at certain points along my journey, knowing that I may not have all the knowledge I need to get past the block, with practice I will be able to strengthen my neuroplasticity and in turn will work alongside that growth mindset. I may not be where I want to be, but with practice time and time again I know that I can reach that point.
